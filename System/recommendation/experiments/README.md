# Experiments Directory

This directory contains experimental and legacy code files that were used during development and testing.

## Files Moved Here

### Experimental Run Scripts
- `run_system.py` - Original experimental runner
- `run_system2.py` - Second iteration of experimental runner
- `run_system3.py` - Third iteration of experimental runner
- `run_system4.py` - Fourth iteration (kept in main directory as current version)

### Legacy Implementations
- `BaseLine.py` - Baseline implementation for comparison
- `basline2.py` - Second baseline implementation
- `content_based_fixed.py` - Fixed version of content-based recommender

## Usage

These files are kept for reference and should not be used in production. The current main system uses:
- `MainSystem.py` as the primary entry point
- `run_system4.py` as the current experimental runner

## Notes

- These files may contain outdated code or experimental features
- They are kept for historical reference and potential reuse
- Some may contain hardcoded paths or experimental configurations
- Use at your own risk and update configurations as needed
